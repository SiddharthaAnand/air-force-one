## AIR FORCE ONE
A 2-D game built using pygame. 

# Back story
You were the captain of a mission which was supposed to carry out 
a deadly operation and retrieve hostages from an enemy location.
But, you were back-stabbed by one of your own lieutenant. All your 
wing commanders have surrendered and you are the one who is fighting
to go back to base.

The enemy has a huge amount of ammunition and missiles which have 
been fired at you continuously through their high-tech surface-to-air
machines. You have to save yourself since your ammunition is completely 
over. You have the radar technology to see the missiles coming from
a little far off and have little time to recover.
